# Rules of the 100 Days Of Linux Challenge

## Main Commitment
### *I will learn and practice for at least an hour every day for the next 100 days.*

#### Start Date
Jan 2nd, 2023. [PUT YOUR DATE HERE]

#### Linux distro of choice
Pop OS 22.04 [PUT YOUR DISTRO HERE]

## Additional Rules
1. I will tweet about my progress every day -> using the hashtag #100DaysOfLinux
2. If I learn at work, that time won't count towards the challenge.
3. I will push learnings and command snippets where possible to GitHub every day so that anyone can see my progress.
4. I will update the (Log)[r1-log.md] with the day's progress and provide a link so that others can see my progress.
5. I will practice on a real linux computer or ssh into an authorized linux server. The time spent doing tutorials, online courses and other similar resources will NOT count towards this challenge.
6. If you can't push your learning to GitHub for some reason (e.g. if you're only starting to learn and doing interactive exercises), provide a link to a tweet. You can think of something else as long as your challenge stays public - and you get the benefit of being committed to it and accountable for your progress.
