### Round 1 Day 1: January 2, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I'm currently in module 5 of NDG Linux Essentials v2 on the Cisco Network Academy. I'm learning about the command line and today, I came across the shell. The Linux Shell is one of the core parts of the linux Operating system and it provides an interface for users to enter commands which tell the kernel what to do. In other words, the linux shell interpretes commands entered in the terminal.
- Bash is the most common shell used in linux. It stands for Bourne Again Shell.

**Command for the day**
- echo $SHELL
