## Log

### Round 1 Day 1: January 2, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I'm currently in module 5 of NDG Linux Essentials v2 on the Cisco Network Academy. I'm learning about the command line and today, I came across the shell. The Linux Shell is one of the core parts of the linux Operating system and it provides an interface for users to enter commands which tell the kernel what to do. In other words, the linux shell interpretes commands entered in the terminal.
- Bash is the most common shell used in linux. It stands for Bourne Again Shell.

**Command for the day**
- echo $SHELL

### Round 1 Day 2: January 2, Monday

**Today's Progress**: 
> The man command
- The primary source of help on how to go about using any command in Linux is by going through the command's manual (man page)
- Other commands like *whatis* and *apropos* will display useful info about some commands too
- It is also important to know where to find these man pages on your system. Commands like *whereis* and *locate* will help with that.
- In addition to the help command, the *info* command can be used to find your way around the OS

> The info command
- The info command provides more and logically related information partaining to a command. It gived you more like a tutorial or cookbook about that command while the man command is more like for reference.

- Man pages are more for quick referencing while info command provides logical and structured documentation.

**Command for the day**
- man ls
- info ls
